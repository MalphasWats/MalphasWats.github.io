Two posts in and I'm already displeased with *every* post being "Weekly Roundup", so I'll drop that part and try and come up with a clever title for each one (see, "finding a path" is *clever* because I've been working on path finding algorithms, but also I'm finding a path to writing more blog stuff. No? Nevermind.)

## RPG

Still a working title ...

## New Lesson - Logo

I added a new [Logo project][LOGO] to my lessons site. This one started life as a word document and I didn't have the screenshots anymore, so I had to save them out of the word doc which lost some quality. It was originally a little Year 7 filler lesson, but I quite like it and it ended up being useful with a few other groups too.

I have about 3 or 4 more 'old' projects that I want to consolidate like this. Once that's done I need to write a whole bunch more for next year!
