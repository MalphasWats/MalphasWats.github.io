I keep all of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/MalphasWats). These are some of my favourites:

## [glixl](https://github.com/MalphasWats/glixl)
glixl is a Javascript framework for making 2D sprite & tile based games using WebGL.

I'm working on a simple game using it too:

* [Dojo Master](http://games.subdimension.co.uk/DojoMaster/)

## [Burble](https://github.com/MalphasWats/burble)
Burble is a cool web interface for posting short 'blurbs' to a GitHub Pages-based site. 

The repository itself is a GitHub Pages site (which needs tidying), but can just be forked, cleared and
used as a micro blog.

I [extended this a little more](https://github.com/MalphasWats/MalphasWats.github.io/blob/master/js/burble.js) 
to use on my main site (this site) to provide a simple web-based front-end for posting to my main site.
