I keep all of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/MalphasWats). These are my favourites.

## Instruments
Instruments is a Flask application skeleton that simply provides a login form and authenticates against a database (PostgreSQL). Functionality, such as a static blog generator, web stats and bookmarking can then be added as 'blueprints' which Instruments will load in at start up.

The primary purpose of Instruments is to provide a single place for login management.

[Instruments is available on GitHub](https://github.com/MalphasWats/instruments)

along with 3 plug-in 'blueprints':

### [Pulse](https://github.com/MalphasWats/pulse)

Pulse is a simple web stats engine; it can be used to track page views and referrers for multiple sites.

### [subMarks](https://github.com/MalphasWats/subMarks)

I wanted my own bookmarking web app, primarily for organising the stuff I find according to projects that I'm working on, rather than hundreds of different tags. subMarks does that.

### [Electrostatic](https://github.com/MalphasWats/electrostatic)

Electrostatic is heavily based on my former system pyDimension. It provides an online front-end for the publishing of a static blog website. Articles are stored as text files marked up with Markdown and static HTML pages are generated from those any time there anything changes. This website is published with Electrostatic.


## pyDimension

pyDimension is a static blogging publishing platform written in Python using the Flask micro-framework. It was my first Python project (which shows in some places!). pyDimension formed the foundation for [Electrostatic](https://github.com/MalphasWats/electrostatic).

[pyDimension is on GitHub](https://github.com/MalphasWats/pyDimension)

I also wrote some blog posts about various problems that I solved during development:

## staticDimension

staticDimension was my first foray into static HTML blogging, written in PHP.
