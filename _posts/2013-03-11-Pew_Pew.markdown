I've really been enjoying noodling about learning HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript and whatnot, I have [plans][LD]!

A couple of weeks ago I started running *Computer Club* at the school I teach at. Last week we started playing around with a space shooter akin to Xenon 2* and its ilk.

The code is available on [GitHub][CODE] and you can also [Play the Game][GAME].

IMPORTANT NOTE: The graphics are intentionally crappy! The idea was to offend the kids' sensibilities so much that they made their own art!! (The game is rubbish because *making games is hard*)

\* Cute fact, my brother and I called this "Exanon" for far longer than either of us care to admit when we were kids.
