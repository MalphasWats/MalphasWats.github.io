Charles Stross posted [an essay][STROSS1] on his blog yesterday investigating some of the issues with space travel. It's difficult to disagree with his analysis of the issues with space travel, which I find bitterly disappointing!

I've decided I'm pinning my hopes of being a starship captain on advances in holographic technologies, at least the chances of explosive decompression are vastly reduced that way.
