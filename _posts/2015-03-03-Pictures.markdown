I have been working on a site for [my photos][PICTURES] and other 'art' for ages now. I've *finally* added a link to
the site in the sidebar.

The site is hosted as a GitHub Pages site, I wanted something really simple but there were some challenges to overcome,
chief of which was being able to post a photo directly from my iPhone. 

I plan to write a post about the python app I wrote in Pythonista that uses the GitHub API to post pictures.

Overall I'm happy with the simple design, although there are still some things I want to do:

* Albums should display photos with their titles, rather than just the same as the stream
* Load the stream as the page scrolls
* Fill in the *About* page.
