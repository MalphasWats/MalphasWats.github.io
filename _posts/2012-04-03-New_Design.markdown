I've spent the last couple of days working on a new design for my site. Since I got my new iPad, the various images I used in my old design were looking a bit ropey.

I noticed [Noah Stokes](http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/post/20052847667/a-new-look) had gone with a text-only site which looks fantastic on the retina-display-endowed iPad. Most of the time I spent working on this was spent looking for a font!

In the end I settled on [Oxygen](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/oxygen) which I think looks nice and clean, but different.

The most notable thing about my new design is that I did all of the work using [Textastic](http://www.textasticapp.com/) on my iPad!  I was quite surprised at how well it worked!
