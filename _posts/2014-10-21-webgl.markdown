I'm at the very early stages of learning and working with web-gl. Now that Apple has added support for it in Mobile Safari it's something that I can get excited about.

Now that I've made it much easier to post and edit blog stuff, I can write a bit more. For now though, this will be a kind of living blog post where I can collect links to the stuff I find.

* [WebGL Fundamentals](http://games.greggman.com/game/webgl-fundamentals/)
* [Getting started with WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebGL/Getting_started_with_WebGL)
* [WebGL pre-tutorial](http://my2iu.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/webgl-pre-tutorial-part-1.html)
* [An Introduction to WebGL](https://dev.opera.com/articles/introduction-to-webgl-part-1/)

Ultimately, I'd like to produce a simple javascript library that's as easy to use as [Jaws.js](http://jawsjs.com/), starting with 2d as it's the performance increase that I'm interested in.
