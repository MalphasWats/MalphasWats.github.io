Things have been moving slowly in the last week on account of a new arrival in our house!

However, I have built the very basic skeleton of an RSS sync system that uses the [Fever API](http://www.feedafever.com/api). Here's a screenshot of [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/iphone/) syncing with my test server (currently only subscribed to the feed for this website!)

The Fever API doesn't allow for editing feeds, so currently in order to add a new subscription to my account, I have to log onto the database server and manually add it, but it's a good start and I think I've got the hardest 2 parts done. Just the huge easy bit of building a webapp to manage it all to go!

I'm planning to enter Ludum Dare tomorrow, just to start easing myself back into coding, so I'll probably be writing a fair bit about that as I go.
