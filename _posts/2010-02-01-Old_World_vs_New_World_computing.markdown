[Old World vs New World computing][LINK]

I came to this via [Daring Fireball][DF], it's a very interesting read.

I've invested a lot of time in learning how to bend computers to my will. I'm now the resident Computer Guy for a *lot* of people (and I'm not even the official Computer Guy). Initially, it's frightening to think that I might not be the Computer Guy in the future, but think of what people will be able to accomplish when they can just do it and it works.

The iPad isn't that device yet, but it's a huge step towards it.
