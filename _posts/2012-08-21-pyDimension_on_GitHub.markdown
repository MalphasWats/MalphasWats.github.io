It's taken me a while to get around to putting this on GitHub, I was a bit nervous about settings files and such, I couldn't quite get my head around how to put them into a public repository without exposing all my secrets (including accidentally in 6 months when I forget and commit my changed versions).

I actually ended up asking the GitHub people what best practice is. They suggested including `.example` files, which is fairly obvious now I know it!

And then I didn't have any excuses any more!

Writing the `README.markdown` file took me most of the morning! It's also still rubbish, so any questions, [feel free to ask](http://subdimension.co.uk/2011/04/05/about_me.html).
