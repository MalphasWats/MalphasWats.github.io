title: CeBIT here I come
---

#{{ page.title }}

When I worked as a Software Engineer, my friends and I used to wonder if we could use our position to get into stuff like E3 and CeBIT. We reckoned that we probably could (and infact I *think* CeBIT is open to all? Not sure.) But we also figured that we couldn't really afford to *get* there.

Since becoming a teacher, these dreams are long gone, teachers don't get to do cool stuff like that, we get the BETT Show instead. That was until I actually went to the BETT Show, I got talking to Samsung there and they were quite interested in doing some stuff with our school and to cut a long story short, I have been invited to CeBIT as a VIP guest of Samsung. I get flown there by private jet, put up in a hotel, the whole works.

I am *so* excited about it, I can't wait.
