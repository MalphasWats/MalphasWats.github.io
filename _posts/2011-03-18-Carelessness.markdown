title: Carelessness

[This piece by John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2011/03/nitro_ios_43) on the changes to Mobile Safari vs. UIWebView makes some sense, and sure, the fact that things aren't any slower anywhere, just faster in some places is a complete non-issue.

I'm more interested in how they managed to break offline caching of pages and data for websites that have been added to the homescreen.

This is an important feature of iOS and it seems a little careless that it got broken.

I'm actually pretty certain there's no [Grand Conspiracy](https://twitter.com/diveintomark/status/48512225597591552) about any of this, but it's a shame that a little more care wasn't taken over the testing of the update - Apple sells its stuff on the experience and this is a bad experience.
