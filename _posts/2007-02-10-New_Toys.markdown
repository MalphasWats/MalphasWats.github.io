My 50mm 1.8D Nikkor beauty arrived this morning! Hurrah! It's everything I hoped it would be, although I can already see that I've got a bit of a learning curve to get my photos right. My first photo is of my beloved Pumpkin. She makes such a wonderful photographic subject, not least because she's very patient for a cat!

I'm really enjoying using Zooomr and having people look at my photographs.

*Edit in 2013*: Sadly, Zooomr is no more. I still have the photo I had posted somewhere so I'll dig it out and upload it at some point.
