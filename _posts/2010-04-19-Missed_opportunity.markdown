title: Missed opportunity
---

It strikes me that with the giant ash cloud hanging over Europe, the UK has missed an opportunity that Spain appears to be about to capitalise on.

[According to the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8629392.stm) Spain is currently in the process of setting itself up as the main hub for European and possibly even N/S American travel. The UK government is sending naval ships in to evacuate stranded Britons.

Now, I am not an Environmental Scientist, Vulcanologist (or indeed Vulcan), but how about if we had, instead of sitting around accepting the ash cloud as Aircraft Enemy #1, doing what Germany are reportedly doing; mapping and working out the limits of what we can and can't do - *we* could then have become the travel hub and reaped the benefit of a boost to *our* economy.

Sure, it might just be that the UK has it the worst, but from what I've been reading over the last couple of days, a lot of the talk has centred around compensation and bailouts.

Shame.
