title: I'm not a web designer...
---

...and it bugs the hell out of me.

I love developing websites, making all the little pieces fit together, building funky php doohickeys and databases and clever javascript thingumies.

What I hate is that I'm completely artistically retarded. This website is still my crowning achievement of design and it's hardly breaking any new ground.

I've been working on some new websites and I find myself turning to sites like [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) which I love for it's fantastic ideas but every time I look at it, I know I'm still only really capable of simply ripping off other people's designs. What to do? Is it possible to learn this "design" thing in the same way I learnt the "develop" thing? I've mentioned before that I don't really believe that you can learn "art", but that I was thinking maybe I could seeing as I'd made some nice steps towards it, but now I'm not so sure. I can reproduce other peoples ideas but I can't create my own and this bugs me.

So what to do? For now, I continue on my quest to learn "art", whilst secretly hoping that I meet a super-designer with the tech-skills of a monkey somewhere along the way.
