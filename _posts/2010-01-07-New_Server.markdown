I've spent the last week or so moving my website onto a new server. Previously I was hosted on a shared server somewhere in Germany but I've outgrown it now, I want to be able to implement my own cool stuff behind the scenes, not just work around with what I've been given.

My new server lives in my own private data-centre (a cupboard under my stairs), I can't remember the specs, because it's one of my old computers, but it will certainly meet my needs for a good while to come!

So far I'm pretty pleased with the results, everything seems to work!
