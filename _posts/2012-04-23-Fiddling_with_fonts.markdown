I decided I preferred the look of a serif font, I was also bothered by the fact that my previous font didn't have bold or italic variants, making it hard to *emphasise* things.

My new font is [Gandhi serif](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/gandhi-serif).

I'll let it sit for a while and see how I like it in a few days.
