There's a button on my laptop that doesn't work.

I've had this laptop for about 2 years. It was the most advanced laptop that money could buy at the time, but even from day 1, the button didn't work.

I exaggerate a little, the button works as long as I don't suspend my computer. As soon as it awakens from sleep the button no longer responds.

As a general rule, I don't need to press the button all that often so it doesn't cause me much inconvenience, but it still irks that I have a very expensive laptop that doesn't work properly. I contacted the manufacturers when I first noticed the issue and they instructed me to re-install the driver for the button. It had no effect, and subsequent calls yielded the same response, so I gave up.

Computing is about learning to accept these errors as part of the experience. "try rebooting it", "uninstall and reinstall the application", "It's always been like that, nothing seems to fix it".

I think things are slowly changing.
