I was inspired by [Nick Douglas' crazy](#link_gone_forever) and thought I'd have a go. Then I realised that I'd already done one, about a year or so ago, which actually puts me ever-so-slightly ahead of the curve that is jumping on the bandwagon! Hurrah for me, I was cool before someone else was!

It looks pretty shit, mainly because I couldn't find a blue enough blue screen, and the only place with enough light was outside where it was windy. But it's just a proof of concept for other stuff anyway :p
