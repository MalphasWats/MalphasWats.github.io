I worked out one of the reasons my [nasty little function](http://subdimension.co.uk/2012/04/20/New_Project_pyDimension.html) is bad:

    if '/' in sPath:
        ...
        month = [sPath.split('/')[1] for x in range(len(days))]

`sPath` was built by walking down into a directory and I used it to work out if I was looking at directories for days or months. This little fragment of code worked fine, until today, when I was running it on my Windows machine.

Windows uses the \ character to separate directories, Python knows this and it helpfully provides a set of functions that deal with it automatically. I just didn't use them:

    if os.path.split(sPath)[0] != '':
        ...
        month = [os.path.split(sPath)[1] for x in range(len(days))]

`os.path` knows all about directory separators.
