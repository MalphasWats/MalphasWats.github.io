#[{{page.title}}]({{page.link}})

I created an awesome little application today for managing OS X Lion's Launchpad.

Irritatingly, I can't work out how to add new apps, the database has thwarted me!

If anyone knows any more about the Launchpad database, please get in [contact](http://subdimension.co.uk/2011/04/05/about_me.html)
