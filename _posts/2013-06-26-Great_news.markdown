[Mr. Reader got an update today](http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/history/index.html), it now supports a whole slew of sync services including *Fever*.

I'm still working hard on [mo.lecul.es, my RSS Sync Service](http://mo.lecul.es) and updated it today to work with Reeder (iPhone), Mr. Reader and Sunstroke. So currently the API side of things is in Private Beta and I'm working on a web frontend to enable management of subscriptions and groups.
