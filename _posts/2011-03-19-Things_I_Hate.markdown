[Let Me Pay](http://log.maniacalrage.net/post/3948497854/please-let-me-pay)

I really hate it when people say "Stop complaining, it's a free service!".

Seriously, fuck off and die.

I agree with what Mr Murray says here - charge for stuff, if it's good, people will use it, price it vaguely profitable and it will support itself.

I am at a loss as to the attraction of Tumblr though, I *really* hate the whole "so and so **likes** this" listed endlessly - great for ego I suppose, but it really does end there.
