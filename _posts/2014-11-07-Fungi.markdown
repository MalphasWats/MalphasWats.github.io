I spent last week in the New Forest with my family. Apparently this year is a very good year for mushrooms. As we were walking around the forest, I saw lots of different types and some of them made some nice photos. I did have a go at [identifying them](http://www.wildaboutbritain.co.uk/british/Fungi/identification) but it's quite tricky and the only one I am reasonably sure about is the second to last one which looks like a [Vermillion Waxcap](http://www.wildaboutbritain.co.uk/vermilion-waxcap).
