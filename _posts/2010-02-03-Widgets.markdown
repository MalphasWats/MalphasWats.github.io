I felt exactly the same about the iPad home screen, it just doesn't look quite right, the spacing of the app icons is too much relative to their size.

Widgets would go a long way to 'solving' the multitasking 'problem', given the right limitations by the OS, they wouldn't negatively impact the user experience - I'd be happy with a little status indicator for my chosen IM app that alerts me that someone has sent me a message and lets me either shoot off a quick reply or launch the full app to join a conversation.

Perfect.
