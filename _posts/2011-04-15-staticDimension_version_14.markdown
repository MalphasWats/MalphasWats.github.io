title: staticDimension - version 1.4
---

I'm on Easter holidays at the moment, I honestly have nothing better to do at the moment!

[staticDimension version 1.4](/files/staticDimension-1.4.tar.gz) takes a shot at making the file management console a little neater and fixes some bugs I found in there, along with a minor security fix.

I'll very probably be slowing down with these releases now!
