title: Advertising - An Update

#{{ page.title }}

[Back in January](/2013/01/22/Advertising.html) I decided to try a short experiment by adding ads to my site, just to see what happened.

I only intended to leave it in place for a couple of months, but I think I've established by now that I'm at the very least a chronic procrastinator.

In the 10 months that I have had adverts on my site, I have made a grand total of **£2.66**; since Google puts a payment threshold of £60.00 on payments, it would take me about 20 years just to get paid.

I don't think I'm uncovering any Grand Truth or anything here - my blog traffic is small, but when I looked at the quality of the adverts I was displaying, I realised that it just wasn't worth it.

I have removed ads and will henceforth be writing for the sheer pleasure.
