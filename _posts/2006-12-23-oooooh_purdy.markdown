I found this today after reading that Google have had a [Dreams in High Fidelity](http://draves.org/blog/archives/000455.html) "Evolving Painting" installed in their lobby. I love this, and as ever it appears that I'm well behind the curve as usual. 

I've stuffed it on my laptop, and to counteract the fact that I never use screensavers, preferring instead to hibernate, I mixed in a bit of [Vital Desktop](http://vital-desktop.sourceforge.net/) which turns my desktop into a virtual sheep pen.

It looks incredible, I'm not entirely sure how it works yet - it started off by downloading some 'seed sheep', I got 3 of those, which took ages to download, then suddenly 2 more arrived very quickly which seemed to be composed of parts of the other 3 I already have. I can't decide if this is just random luck, or if it was deliberately interpolating between ones I already had, or if the ones I had have already evolved into new ones.

It's all very intriguing, I shall have to spend a few hours staring at them...
