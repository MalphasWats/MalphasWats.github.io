#{{ page.title }}


I've published a new version of [staticDimension](/pages/projects.html) today that incorporates a link post feature for articles. Still fairly basic, but seems to do the job!

I also created a [change log](/pages/staticDimension_changelog.html) page I'll keep up-to-date as I make changes (obviously).
