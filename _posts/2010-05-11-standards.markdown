With all the fuss in the tech press about Flash, HTML5 and H.264 et al, it's easy to get caught up in the buzz.

[this article from Webmonkey](http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/05/embed-videos-in-your-web-pages-using-html5/) tells it a litle closer to how it is - support is spotty at best.

HTML5 is still a long way off being finalised. I think Flash will be hanging around for a while yet.
