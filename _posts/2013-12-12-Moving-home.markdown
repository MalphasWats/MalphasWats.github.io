#{{page.title}}

I've spent the last couple of days moving my website from my virtual host over to GitHub Pages. I've been overtaxing the server it sits on and it kept falling over. I want my website to be a little bit more stable!

I'm going to write up some of the problems I came across over the next week or so, but I just wanted to see how easy it was to write a new post directly on the website!

Things I still need to do:

- Implement some kind of search system
- Trawl for broken links
- Write a Python module for publishing posts right out of [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/)
- I also need to fix the way posts are displayed in the RSS Feed!
