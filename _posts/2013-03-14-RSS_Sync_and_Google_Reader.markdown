#{{ page.title }}

Google [announced][GREADER] yesterday that they are shuttering Reader. I'm rather sad about this since I use Reader and a number of apps that interface with it **many** times every day. It's the first tab I open when I start my browser.

Back in 2011 I wrote [a post][POST] about developing my own system. I've noticed that it's getting quite a few pageviews at the moment! I did indeed begin developing my own service, but it was a bit of a [forever project][FOREVER] for me. I have a domain, a database and a skeleton api but nothing fully working; **yet**.

I'm going to switch priorities on this now and start building something that I would be happy to use myself in place of Google Reader.

*Maybe* my forever project could become my *forever career*
